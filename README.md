# Optimalization-Methods
A collection of tasks from the Optimization Methods course (2nd semester of master’s studies). Contains linear programming solutions using GNU MathProg, JuMP (Julia), and GLPK.

## Description

This repository contains tasks completed as part of the **Optimization Methods** course during the second semester of master’s studies. The main focus is on **linear programming (LP)** — modeling and solving optimization problems using various tools and languages.

## Technologies and Tools

- **GNU MathProg** – for building optimization models (similar to AMPL)
- **JuMP** – a modeling language for optimization in **Julia**
- **GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit)** – solver for LP/MIP problems
